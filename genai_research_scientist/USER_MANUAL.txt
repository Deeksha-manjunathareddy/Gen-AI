GenAI Personal Research Scientist - User Manual
===============================================

Overview
--------
The GenAI Personal Research Scientist is an interactive Streamlit web app that helps you
quickly explore a research question using a semi-automated pipeline:

- Retrieve and summarize relevant literature (from a local sample corpus)
- Extract key insights, methods, and results
- Generate several testable hypotheses
- Design an experiment for the most promising hypothesis
- Produce a structured research-style draft with citations

This tool is intended for idea generation and planning. You should always read the
original papers and apply your own judgment before running real experiments.


Basic Workflow
--------------
1. Launch the app:
   - From a terminal, change into the `genai_research_scientist` folder.
   - Run: `streamlit run app.py`
   - Your browser should open automatically (or visit the printed localhost URL).

2. On the "Home" tab:
   - Enter a clear research question, for example:
     "What are effective techniques for aligning large language models with human preferences?"
   - Optionally adjust creativity (temperature) in the sidebar.
   - Click "Run Research Pipeline".

3. Wait for the pipeline to complete:
   - You will see progress indicators and short status texts (search, extraction,
     hypotheses, experiment, draft).
   - When finished, a success message appears and the other tabs will show content.


Exploring Results
-----------------
1. Literature tab:
   - View the top retrieved documents from the local sample corpus.
   - Expand each card to see a title, approximate relevance score, and a summary snippet.
   - You can replace or add your own `.txt` files in `assets/sample_docs` to customize this.

2. Hypotheses tab:
   - Review 3–5 automatically generated hypotheses.
   - The primary (starred) hypothesis is selected as the best candidate for experimentation.
   - Each hypothesis includes rationale, testability, and risk notes.

3. Experiment tab:
   - See a compact experiment design based on the primary hypothesis:
     objectives, setup, datasets/models guidance, metrics, and risks/mitigations.
   - Use this as a starting point and adapt to your own research constraints.

4. Draft tab:
   - Read the structured research draft (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work,
     Hypotheses, Methodology, Expected Outcomes, References).
   - This is generated as Markdown; you can copy sections or download the full draft.


Downloading the Draft
---------------------
The sidebar includes download options once a draft has been generated:

- "Download Draft (Markdown)" always works and saves a `.md` file.
- "Download Draft (PDF)" is available if the optional `reportlab` library is installed.

You can open the Markdown file in any text editor or document tool that supports Markdown
and continue editing and polishing it.


Customizing the Corpus
----------------------
By default, the app uses a small sample text file in `assets/sample_docs`. To add your
own documents:

1. Place plain-text `.txt` files into `assets/sample_docs`.
2. Each file is treated as a separate document; the filename (without extension) becomes
   its title in the UI.
3. Re-run the app; the RAG-style search will now index your custom corpus.


Model Integration (Optional)
----------------------------
The reference implementation uses deterministic, template-based logic for summaries,
hypotheses, and experiment design to remain self-contained and copy-paste friendly.

If you want to use external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Groq, HF, etc.):

1. Identify where to integrate:
   - For extraction: `modules/extraction_agent.py` and `modules/generator.py`
   - For hypotheses and experiments: `modules/hypothesis_agent.py`,
     `modules/experiment_agent.py`, and `modules/generator.py`
2. Replace the template-based functions with your own LLM calls.
3. Pass your API key(s) as environment variables or Streamlit secrets, never hard-code them.


Common Issues
-------------
- No documents or low-quality results:
  - Ensure there is at least one `.txt` file in `assets/sample_docs`.
  - Use a more general research question or refine your wording.

- PDF download button does not appear:
  - Install `reportlab` (`pip install reportlab`) and restart the app.

- Streamlit app not opening:
  - Check the console for errors.
  - Make sure you are running `streamlit run app.py` from inside the project folder.


Safety and Limitations
----------------------
- The outputs are generated by templates and simple models and are not a substitute
  for rigorous peer-reviewed research.
- Always validate hypotheses and experiment designs with domain experts.
- Never use the tool as the sole basis for high-stakes decisions.
