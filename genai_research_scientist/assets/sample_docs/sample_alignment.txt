Alignment of large language models with human preferences is a central problem in modern AI research.
Techniques such as supervised finetuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red-teaming
are commonly explored. Recent work suggests that scaling both data and model size improves performance,
but can also amplify misalignment if not carefully managed.

Several studies evaluate alignment along dimensions such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness.
Researchers experiment with reward modeling, preference optimization, and hybrid approaches that
combine rule-based constraints with neural methods.

Despite promising progress, open questions remain around robustness, distribution shift, and how to
measure long-term societal impact. This sample document is intentionally short and simplified, and is
included purely so that the demo RAG pipeline has something to retrieve and summarize.
